- As latitude increases, temperatures decreases (City Latitude vs. Max Temp)
  Cities at higher latitude have lower Max Temps

- There aren't any strong correlations between latitude and humidity (City Latitude vs. Humidity)
  The cities with the lowest humidities are concentrated near 0 latitude (the Equator)
  
- There aren't any strong correlations between latitude and cloudiness (City Latitude vs. Cloudiness)

- There aren't any strong correlations between latitude and wind speed (City Latitude vs. Wind Speed)
  However, the cities with the strongest wind speeds are concentrated at the high (+)latitudes.
 
- There's a weak correlation between temperature and latitude. As latitude increases in the northern hemisphere, the max temperature decreases. (Northern Lat. vs. Temperature)

- Likewise, as the latitude increases in the southern hemisphere, the max temperature increases. (Southern Lat. vs. Temperature)

- In the northern hemisphere, cities tend to have higher humidity as latitude increases. (Northern Lat. vs. Humidity)
  But cities at lower latitude are more likely to have lower humidities as well.

- In the southern hemisphere, cities at higher latitudes are more likely to have lower humidities. (Southern Lat. vs. Humidity)

- Both northern and southern hemisphere cities are more likely to experience more cloudiness as the latitude increases. (Northern/Southern Lat. vs. Cloudiness)

- In the northern hemisphere, there appears to be no strong correlation between wind speed and latitude. (Northern Lat. vs Wind Speed)

- In the southern hemisphere, it appears that cities closer to equator are more likely to experience high wind speeds.
